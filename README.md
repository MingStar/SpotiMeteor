SpotiMeteor
===

Work based on 2 open source Spotify jukebox repo:

* code from [meteor-spotify](https://github.com/alanshaw/meteor-spotify) as back end, controlling Spotify.
* code from [SpotiPI](https://github.com/abartow/SpotiPI) as front end UI, using Bootstrap.

Getting started
---
(Note: This is OSX only, since `spotify-node-applescript` uses applescript to talk to Spotify.)

Install [Meteor](http://meteor.com).

Open Spotify.

Run in project directory:

```sh
meteor
open http://localhost:3000
```
